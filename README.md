# w3champions-lutris
lutris install file for Battle.net and W3Champions using new W3Champs launcher

# Installation
These are the steps I took to get W3Champions new launcher running.

To start with I set my wine configuration in Lutris (clicking the Configure-cog on the left menu under "Runners") to use **Wine version**:  **System (10.3(Staging))**.

Then install using the w3c.yaml file in this repo.

When the battle.net install finishes, log in and install Warcraft III. 

Run Warcraft III and then exit battle.net to proceed with the install.
